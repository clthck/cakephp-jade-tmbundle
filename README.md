# JadePHP.tmbundle (supports CakePHP 3 Jade template engine)

**This was made specifically for Sublime Text 2, but was tested and works with Textmate 2 and Sublime Text 3**

This is an improved version of [jade-tmbundle](http://github.com/davidrios/jade-tmbundle) especially updated for **CakePHP 3**.
In order to use Jade template engine in **CakePHP 3**, you need to install [cakephp-jade](http://github.com/clthck/cakephp-jade) using `composer`.

## Installation

### Using Package Control in SUblime Text 2/3

Package Control is not supported yet.

### TextMate 2

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles
    git clone https://github.com/clthck/cakephp-jade-tmbundle.git JadePHP.tmbundle

### Sublime Text manual installation

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/clthck/cakephp-jade-tmbundle.git JadePHP

Replace '2' with '3' in case of Sublime Text 3.

Patches for additions are always welcome.
